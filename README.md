Italics (_ before and after the word)
Bold (** before and after the word)

Making links
Inline link : eg. [visit github!](www.github.com) the first part within [] is inline link. Then you wrap the link with ()


Reference links
They are links within the same page

When quoting from another source just add the symbol> before the paragraph starts if there are several small paragraphs with blank line in between add the symbol in front of the blank line also. So that we know the group of paragraphs are quotes.

Ordered and unordered list
Unordered list has * before each item and ordered list has a number eg 1. 2.

For nesting list just indent the * by one or two spaces

Soft breaks ..
